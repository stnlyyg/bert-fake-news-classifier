# Introduction
This is my personal project in order to implement my understanding in my AI Engineering study on using transformers model for NLP task. This is a machine learning project that classifies news article as **real** or **fake**, using a fine-tuned bert-base-uncased transformer model. This project features:

- NLP model with Hugging Face Transformers
- FastAPI backend for prediction service
- Gradio frontend for quick interaction
- Dockerized setup for easy deployment

# Project Overview

Fake news has become a major concern across digital media. This project aims to detect and classify fake news using a transformer-based NLP model (like BERT).
This project interaction can be made via:
- A FastAPI REST API
- A Gradio web interface
